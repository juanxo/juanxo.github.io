Book Review - Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman
===============

A couple of weeks ago [@pasku1](https://twitter.com/pasku1), in an effort to make me someone useful, gave me a list of books
about "Best Practices" and "Domain Driven Design", pointing out that ["Apprenticeship Patterns:
Guidance for the Aspiring Software
Craftsman"](http://books.google.es/books?id=I3xFAoZT_5AC&num=10&hl=es) could be a great starting point.

I have read books like this in the past (Clean Coder, Pragmatic Programmer, etc) but I have tried to
tackle this book witha fresh point of view, because someone took the effort to recommend it to me.

This book is mostly about common sense in programming, sadly the least common of the senses. You won't find specific technical advance,
or code using the trend of this week. This is more about setting the basis about how to behave like
a craftsman(in this way, it's really similar to Clean Coders).

If I could draw a conclusion for me, it would be to Empty my Cup, and fast. I know that, from my experience, it's going to be one of the most difficult for me to
do.

I say this because I have been programming for several years using different technologies and I'm good relating
aspects of different things(or so I think). That, combined to my stupid desire to be acknowledged as someone
skilled among peers many times makes me hide my limitations and try to be a "know all" guy.

It's never to late to awake of my comfort zone and put myself in a position where I can Be the
Worst, learning from other people that share my passion and are willing to teach and mentor me,
starting by finishing all the call to actions listed in each pattern or
attending local meetups and conferences about things I have been interested in lately, like Functional
Programming, Front End Development and TDD/Best Practices.

There is a lot to do, but I actually prefer it this way. After all,  Walking the Long Road starts with just a step.
