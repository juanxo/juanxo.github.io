Juan Guerrero is a developer that started his journey playing games and growing up wanting to make
them, but never dived into programming until his first year of college.

Now he works at NEC as a backend developer, among other things. He also like to give courses and
talks to improve the work and workflows of his mates, solve other people problems and, specially,
creating tools to support great development teams.

He comes from the sunny Spain, and he likes basketball, learning new programming languages and tools, hacking open source projects on
whatever latest technologies, frontend development and web performance optimization.

The legend says that if you send him [an email](mailto:juan.guerrero.lozano@gmail.com) he will get
back to you some day.
